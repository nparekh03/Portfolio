# How to Enable GitHub Pages (Step by Step)

Since the Save button isn't showing, try these options:

## Option 1: Use the Next.js Workflow Card (Easiest!)

On the GitHub Pages settings page, you should see a card that says:
- **"Next.js"** 
- "By GitHub Actions"
- "Package a Next.js site"
- Has a **"Configure"** button

**Click the "Configure" button** on that card. This will:
- Create/enable the workflow
- Set up GitHub Pages automatically
- You don't need a Save button for this!

## Option 2: The Workflow Might Already Be Running

1. Go to the **Actions** tab: https://github.com/nparekh03/Portfolio/actions
2. Check if there's a workflow run in progress or completed
3. If it completed successfully, GitHub Pages might already be enabled!

## Option 3: Manual Trigger

If nothing works, we can manually trigger the workflow by making a small change and pushing it.

**Try Option 1 first** - click "Configure" on the Next.js card. That's usually the easiest way!
